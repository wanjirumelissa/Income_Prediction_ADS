# Income_Prediction_ADS

The objective of the OLS regression model is to forecast the variable &quot;income&quot; by utilizing
the following independent variables: &quot;employ,&quot; &quot;car,&quot; &quot;carcat,&quot; &quot;age,&quot; and &quot;inkcat.&quot; 
Here is a thorough explanation of the main elements.
R-squared: The model provides an explanation for roughly 65.9% of the variation observed in
the dependent variable, &quot;income.&quot; This points to a somewhat strong explanatory capacity. It&#39;s
crucial to remember that additional evaluations are required to determine whether the model
is practically significant; R-squared alone cannot do this.
Age (age): The coefficient is -0.0074, indicating that income and age have a slight negative
correlation. The p-value (0.475), however, is not statistically significant, suggesting that in
this model, age may not have a significant effect on income.
Income Category (inccat): The coefficient is -0.1238, meaning that income generally tends to
decline as the income category rises. With a low p-value of 0.000, this relationship is
statistically significant.
Ownership of a car: The coefficient, which stands at 0.8915, indicates a highly positive
correlation. Car ownership is typically associated with higher incomes. With a p-value of
0.000, the relationship is highly statistically significant.
The coefficient for Employment Duration (employ) is 0.1336, indicating a positive
correlation. Higher salaries are correlated with longer employment periods. P-value: 0.000
indicates that the relationship is statistically significant.
Model Assessment
F-statistic: The model as a whole is statistically significant, with an F-statistic of 1977. The
likelihood linked to the F-statistic is extremely near to zero (0.00), thereby enhancing the
significance of the model.
